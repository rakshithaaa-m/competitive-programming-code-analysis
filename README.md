Introduction:
This project focuses on analyzing code submissions from competitive programming contests. The main goal is to study patterns, performance metrics, and trends in participantsâ€™ code submissions. Insights from this analysis can help understand coding behavior, optimize strategies, and improve performance in competitive programming.

Installation:
1)Clone the repository:
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>

2)Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  

3)Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
1)Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook notebooks/Codeforces_Submission_Analysis.ipynb

2)Run each cell sequentially to:
Load datasets
Preview data
Perform analysis on code submissions
Generate visualizations and statistics

3)Optionally, use generate_samples.py to create sample datasets:
python generate_samples.py

Features:
1)Dataset preview and exploration
2)Analysis of code submission patterns
3)Performance metrics across problems and participants
4)Visualizations for easier interpretation

Contributing:
1)Fork the repository
2)Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-name)
3)Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add feature')
4)Push to the branch (git push origin feature-name)
